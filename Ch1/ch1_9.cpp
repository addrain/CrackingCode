 * String Rotation: Assume you have a method isSubstring which 
 * checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, 
 * s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using 
 * only one call to isSubstring (e.g., "waterbottle" is a rotation 
 * of "erbottlewat").
 * 
 * Will work on later.
 * Can double one of the strings and call isSubstring.  Ex: waterbottle is a substring of erbottlewaterbottlewat
 * 
 * or, get the first unique letter or pair of letters to rotate the other string.
 * 
 * I like the first solution better.
